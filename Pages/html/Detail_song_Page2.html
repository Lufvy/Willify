                        <p>You're insecure
                            Don't know what for
                            You're turning heads when you walk through the door
                            Don't need make-up, to cover up
                            Being the way that you are is enough
                            
                            Everyone else in the room can see it
                            Everyone else but you
                            
                            Baby you light up my world like nobody else
                            The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed
                            But when you smile at the ground it ain't hard to tell
                            You don't know, oh oh
                            You don't know you're beautiful
                            If only you saw what I can see
                            You'll understand why I want you so desperately
                            Right now I'm looking at you and I can't believe
                            You don't know, oh oh

                            That's what makes you beautiful
                            
                            So come on, you got it wrong
                            To prove I'm right, I put it in a song
                            I don't know why, you're being shy
                            And turn away when I look into your eye eye eyes
